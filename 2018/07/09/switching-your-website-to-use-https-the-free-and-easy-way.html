<p>One such option is to use <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/ssl/">CloudFlare’s free SSL</a>.  Security expert <a href="https://twitter.com/troyhunt">Troy Hunt</a> has a fantastic 4-part video series called <a href="https://httpsiseasy.com/">Https Is Easy!</a> that takes you through the simple steps to secure your site.</p>

<h2 id="fixing-mixed-content-issues-on-wordpress-sites">Fixing Mixed Content Issues on WordPress Sites</h2>

<p>While I was able to get a couple of my websites switched to HTTPS with no issues in a matter of minutes, I ran into issues with one of my Azure-hosted WordPress sites.  Much of the site’s functionality broke in the switch and I was now getting a host of mixed content errors, particularly with plugins that I was using, like the following:</p>

<p><img src="mixed_content_error.png" alt="img" /></p>

<p>The fix for this is simple: install the <strong>SSL Insecure Content Fixer</strong> plugin.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.jonblankenship.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/ssl_insecure_content_fixer-300x183.png" alt="img" /></p>

<p>Once installed, open the Settings for the plugin.  I was able to leave all of the settings at their default except for <strong>HTTPS detection</strong>.  Change this setting to use <strong>HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PROTO (e.g. load balancer, reverse proxy, NginX)</strong>, as this is the header that CloudFlare uses.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.jonblankenship.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/https_detection.png" alt="img" /></p>

<p>After applying this change, my mixed content errors went away, my site was secured, and I was good to go.</p>
