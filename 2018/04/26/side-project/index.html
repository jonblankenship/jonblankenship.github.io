          <p>It’s been awhile since I’ve done any serious side-project work.  I’ve not had the energy or time to work on a personal project since I started working for my current employer almost three years ago, and, honestly, I haven’t felt much of a need.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>When I joined my current employer three years ago, any side projects that I had in flight stopped dead in their tracks because – after years of consulting for the state – I was all of sudden working on interesting problems, being challenged daily, playing with cool new technologies, and building something new and innovative.  The needs I had satisfied previously after hours working on side projects (i.e., the desires to create, innovate, and learn new things) were now being satisfied at work.</p>

<p>I’ve got a bit more free time these days, and while I’m still being challenged at work, I’ve been looking for a project that I can spend some free time on with a few goals in mind:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Sharpen my skills on familiar (to me) tech</li>
  <li>Work on new problems</li>
  <li>Create something neat (and perhaps profitable)</li>
  <li>Learn some new (to me) tech when appropriate</li>
</ul>

<p>I’ve got some ideas for my next project(s).  I’m not ready to reveal what they are yet, but here’s a peek at just a few of the things I intend to use/work with in the coming months:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Natural language processing</li>
  <li>Machine learning</li>
  <li>Azure Service Fabric</li>
  <li>ASP.Net Core</li>
  <li>Some sort of API management to support monetization</li>
  <li>Xamarin.Forms to target iOS/Android/Windows</li>
</ul>

<p>So why am I sharing this publicly?  A few reasons…</p>

<ol>
  <li>I wish I would have kept a journal of projects that I’ve worked on in the past to serve as my own personal reference for problems I’ve encountered and lessons learned.  This will be that journal.</li>
  <li>Communicating what I’m working on helps to sharpen my thoughts and aid in my understanding and retention.</li>
  <li>Sharing my progress will help to keep me accountable when my motivation wanes or my progress slows.</li>
  <li>It may be helpful to someone out there.  I hope it is.</li>
</ol>

<p>I will work on this as time and energy permits.  I hope to post somewhat regularly and frequently, but I make no promises.</p>

<p>That said, thank you for joining me!</p>
