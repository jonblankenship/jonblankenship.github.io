<p>In my almost two decades as a developer I‚Äôve become increasingly aware of what matters to me in a job, having been in half dozen different environments that excel in some traits but are lacking in others.</p>

<p>This list is my list of the things that are most important to me in a dev job at this time in my life.</p>

<p>This list changes with time as my circumstances and priorities change.</p>

<p>This list is likely different than your list.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs rare to find your ‚Äúdream job‚Äù that fits all of your criteria.</p>

<p>Oftentimes you must compromise some of the less important traits for some of the more important ones.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve done this.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs OK, as long as you understand the trade-offs you‚Äôre making.</p>

<p>Early in your career you have fewer choices.  You can‚Äôt afford to be picky.</p>

<p>This is OK, because you likely have‚Ä¶</p>

<p>‚úî  More time<br />
‚úî  More to learn<br />
‚úî  Fewer limitations<br />
‚úî  More to experience</p>

<p>I share this list in hopes that it will help someone out there think critically about their next career move.</p>

<p>So without further ado, my Top 10 Desired Traits in a Development Job (roughly in order of importance):</p>

<h2 id="1-remote-first-culture-">1. Remote-First Culture üè°</h2>

<p>Being able to work remotely is key for me - I won‚Äôt ever work in an office again if I can avoid it.</p>

<p>The freedom to see my kids when they get home from school, have a coffee break with my wife, and just share more ‚Äúregular‚Äù moments of daily life with my family is priceless.</p>

<p>I can‚Äôt get back the hours I‚Äôve spent commuting to and from work, but going forward I can appreciate the time that I won‚Äôt spend sitting behind the wheel every day.</p>

<p>The company should be remote first, with remote work ingrained in the company culture.</p>

<p>I don‚Äôt want to be the odd man out on a team of mostly co-located coworkers.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs not enough for a company to simply slap a few Skype invites on their meeting requests and call it a day.</p>

<p>A healthy expectation for remote workers is needed.</p>

<p>Bad:  Since you‚Äôre remote, you should be available 24/7.</p>

<p>Good:  40 hrs/wk is enough.  Though there may be an occasional week where extra hours are needed, usually you put in your 40 hrs &amp; then go enjoy your non-work life.</p>

<h2 id="2-culture-of-craftsmanship-">2. Culture of Craftsmanship üõ†</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>craft (n.): an art, trade, or occupation requiring special skill</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Good software is produced when development is viewed as a craft.</p>

<p>Bad software is produced when development is viewed as an assembly line process.</p>

<p>I want to work with colleagues who view their work as a craft to be honed.</p>

<p>I don‚Äôt want to work for a company that views development as mechanical process that can be streamlined by simply adding more metrics, KPIs, and process.</p>

<p>Benefits of a culture of craftsmanship:</p>

<p>‚úî Higher quality<br />
‚úî Pride of ownership<br />
‚úî Continuous improvement</p>

<h2 id="3-software-is-the-product-">3. Software is the Product üíæ</h2>

<p>There is a big difference between working for a company where software development is a supporting function vs. one where it is the primary function.</p>

<p>Cost center vs. profit center mentality.</p>

<p>I recently <a href="https://twitter.com/Jon_Blankenship/status/1261703417489211392">tweeted about this</a>.</p>

<p>When viewed as a cost center, the emphasis is on keeping costs down.</p>

<p>This usually means minimizing investment the people and processes involved in producing software, since it is not the company‚Äôs core function.</p>

<p>When viewed as a profit center, the emphasis is on maximizing profits.</p>

<p>This usually means investing in the people and processes involved in producing the main product, which contributes directly to the company‚Äôs bottom line.</p>

<p>In my experience, the cost center attitude is ‚ÄúGet it done.‚Äù</p>

<p>The profit center attitude is ‚ÄúGet it done well.‚Äù</p>

<p>I much prefer the latter.</p>

<h2 id="4-observes-development-best-practices-">4. Observes Development Best Practices üë®‚Äçüíª</h2>

<p>This one is a byproduct of a culture of craftsmanship.</p>

<p>A team that strives to produce quality software follows best practices.</p>

<p>Best practices include‚Ä¶</p>

<p>‚úî YAGNI<br />
‚úî Clean code<br />
‚úî Defensive code<br />
‚úî Design patterns<br />
‚úî Consistent style<br />
‚úî SOLID principles<br />
‚úî Automated tests<br />
‚úî Minimize complexity<br />
‚úî Side-effect free functions<br />
‚úî etc‚Ä¶</p>

<p>Using good development practices promotes‚Ä¶</p>

<p>üëç quality<br />
üëç reliability<br />
üëç readability<br />
üëç maintainability<br />
üëç robustness</p>

<p>A clean, well-structured, well-tested codebase is also more enjoyable to work in.</p>

<p>This is the kind of codebase I prefer to work in.</p>

<h2 id="5-observes-devops-best-practices-">5. Observes DevOps Best Practices üíª</h2>

<p>A company that prioritizes software quality prioritizes DevOps.</p>

<p>An investment in DevOps goes a long way towards improving the lives of the developers.</p>

<p>The benefits of DevOps automation are many:</p>

<p>‚òë Higher stability<br />
‚òë Higher throughput<br />
‚òë Easier deployments<br />
‚òë Reduced human error<br />
‚òë Less developer time spent on deployments</p>

<h2 id="6-talented-and-driven-colleagues-">6. Talented and Driven Colleagues üë©‚Äçüíª</h2>

<p>I want to work with colleagues who will make me better by working alongside them.</p>

<p>These aren‚Äôt people who simply punch the clock to earn their paycheck.</p>

<p>They‚Äôre talented, smart, curious, and driven individuals who take pride in their work.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve worked with several people like this over my career, and they‚Äôre responsible for much of my growth as a developer, for which I‚Äôm indebted.</p>

<p>You can‚Äôt help but grow in your craft if you‚Äôre interacting with talented individuals on a daily basis via design meetings, code reviews, debugging sessions, architectural discussions, etc‚Ä¶</p>

<h2 id="7-anti-enterprise-">7. Anti-Enterprise üè¢</h2>

<p>By ‚Äúanti-enterprise,‚Äù I mean a company where there is minimal corporate process/bureaucracy.</p>

<p>I prefer working for a small, fast company over a large, slow enterprise.</p>

<p>I have a low tolerance for waste.</p>

<p>I prefer to spend my time creating value rather than sitting in meetings and entering support tickets.</p>

<p>I want to be empowered to do the things that I need to do to do my job.</p>

<p>I don‚Äôt want to have to‚Ä¶<br />
‚Ü™ spend 15 minutes entering a change request<br />
‚Ü™ to have a dev database restored<br />
‚Ü™ that will take a week to complete<br />
‚Ü™ that would have otherwise taken me 5 minutes<br />
‚Ü™ if given the adequate permissions.</p>

<p>I don‚Äôt like to be handcuffed by process.</p>

<p>I have no desire to climb the corporate ladder or play status games.</p>

<h2 id="8-potential-for-professional-growth-">8. Potential for Professional Growth üìà</h2>

<p>I want to be challenged to grow professionally.</p>

<p>My growth as a developer is a function of‚Ä¶</p>

<p>1Ô∏è‚É£ my own initiative,<br />
2Ô∏è‚É£ the project(s) I‚Äôm working on, and<br />
3Ô∏è‚É£ the people that I‚Äôm working with.</p>

<p>The greatest periods of growth in my career have been a result of not only own initiative, but also the fact that I was working on interesting projects with, more importantly, smart colleagues (#6).</p>

<p>Your potential to grow as a developer will change over the course of your time with a company.</p>

<p>Often this potential is greatest when you first join and diminishes over time, but not always.</p>

<p>New projects or new team members can rekindle the fires of growth.</p>

<h2 id="9-clear-line-from-contribution-to-value-">9. Clear Line from Contribution to Value ‚û°</h2>

<p>I want to be able to see how my contribution contributes to the success of the company.</p>

<p>This contributes to a greater satisfaction in a job well done.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs easier to see how your contribution affects the overall success of the company when ‚Ä¶</p>

<p>‚úî the company is small (#7), and<br />
‚úî software is the product (#3).</p>

<h2 id="10-compensationbenefitsequity-">10. Compensation/Benefits/Equity üíµ</h2>

<p>This one comes last in my top 10, but that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not important.</p>

<p>I want to be compensated fairly for my work.  Ideally that includes equity in the company.</p>

<p>If my contribution is tied to the success of the company, I prefer my compensation to be as well.</p>

<p>Once equity enters the equation, you shift from purely trading time for money, to trading time for money + a stake in something of potentially great value.</p>

<p>Being well-compensated is one way that a company can show me that my contribution is valued.</p>
