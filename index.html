It’s been slow but steady progress, and I’m happy to report that both the Create Alert Definition and Edit Alert Definition screens are now functional. (Technically they’re both the same screen, but I’ve been treating them separately from a work management perspective.)</p>

		<div class="post"><p>This week I added the ability to post and properly display markdown content in my <a href="https://blazor.net/">Blazor</a> (server-side Blazor, actually… Razor Components) project. Markdown is a lightweight, standardized way of formatting text without having to resort to HTML or depend on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG">WYSIWYG</a> editor. There’s a nice markdown quick reference <a href="https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet">here</a>.</p>

		<div class="post"><p>One of my projects’ home screen is composed of multiple Blazor components that make a web service calls in their respective <code class="highlighter-rouge">OnInitAsync()</code>s to retrieve their data.  When loading the page, all of the components render immediately in their unpopulated state; each one then updates and fills out as the various web service calls complete and their data loads.  I’m not a fan of this – I’d rather have a nice overlay with some sort of loading indicator hiding the components while they’re loading that disappears when the last component is ready for display.  This weekend I developed a simple pattern for accomplishing just that.</p>

		<div class="post"><p>I’ve been playing with <a href="https://blazor.net/">Blazor</a> for several weeks now, and it’s fantastic.  For the uninitiated, Blazor allows you to write .NET code that runs in the browser through the power of <a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly (Wasm)</a>.  This means that the amount of JavaScript you end up having to write to create a dynamic web UI is significantly reduced, or even eliminated (check out this <a href="https://sql-mistermagoo.github.io/bletris">Tetris clone</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/mistermag00">@mistermag00</a> wrote running completely on Blazor with <strong>ZERO</strong> JavaScript).</p>

		<div class="post"><p>I’m generally a strong proponent of using separate models for commmunicating across service boundaries that are separate and distinct from my core domain model. In a typical web application that is backed by a database, this usually means that I have a domain model, a storage model, and a view model, and I map between storage model ↔ domain model and between domain model ↔ view model when crossing their respective boundaries. This keeps my domain model isolated, ensures that it is not forced to change due to concerns in another layer, and promotes adherence to the <a href="https://8thlight.com/blog/uncle-bob/2014/05/08/SingleReponsibilityPrinciple.html">Single Responsibility Principle</a> (a class should have one, and only one, reason to change).</p>
